# IoT Safety Monitoring – Load Detection

This project is a simple IoT-based safety monitoring system built with ESP32 and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

The system measures distance in real-time, activates a buzzer and LED as warning indicators, and sends the data to a local web server for monitoring via a web interface.

### Tech Stack
- ESP32
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
